Description: # narpy - NASA AMES Reader for Python
        narpy is a simple NASA AMES file Reader for Python. There didn't seem to be any functioning libraries for opening .na or NASA AMES files in Python so this is what I ended up with. Functionality is fairly limited but gets the core needs done.
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install narpy` (coming soon)
        
        ## Usage
        
        `$ python
        >>> import narpy as na
        >>> f=na.file("example.na")
        >>> f["x"].data
        [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
        >>> f.comment
        This is an example file`
